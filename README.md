## OJS Transition

Early autum 2021 we, the [Journal of Statistical Software][jss]
transition to a new version of the [Open Journal System][ojs]
as our editorial management system.

To handle requests regarding the new system (if anything is unclear
or in case bugs occur) we decided to make use of [github][github]
[issues][issues]. All of you can help us with this transition and to
improve our guidelines and the editorial management workflow.

* Please check the [list of issues][issues] to see if the
    problem/ambiguity/bug you are facing has already been reported.
    Feel free to leave a comment such that we can better prioritize
    open issues.
* If not yet reported, please [open a new issue][new] and place your
    question/findings. We try to address them a.s.a.p..
* If you do not want to create a [github][github] account you can
    find the contact information for the _Support Contact_
    on our [website][reto].
