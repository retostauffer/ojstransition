## Transition to new editorial system

In September 2021, the [Journal of Statistical Software][jss] transitions
to version 3 of the [Open Journal System][ojs] after using version as
the editorial management system for a number of years.

Such transitions usually bring not only many nice and useful new
features - in this case in particular a modern responsive frontend
and a much more transparent backend that is a lot easier to use -
but are typically also accompanied by some problems that need to be
ironed out. Therefore, we decided to leverage [GitHub issues][issues]
of a dedicated project where problems and bugs can be reported and
solutions and workarounds can be posted. Thus, all JSS readers and
authors can help us with this transition and with improving our
guidelines and editorial workflow.

* Please check the [list of issues][issues] to see if the
    problem/ambiguity/bug you are facing has already been reported.
    Feel free to leave a comment such that we can better prioritize
    open issues.
* If not yet reported, please [open a new issue][new] and place your
    question/findings. We try to address them as soon as possible.
* If you do not want to create a GitHub account you can
    find the contact information for the _Support Contact_
    on our [website][reto].
